The traditional definition of an emergency fund is a separate account for cash that can be used instead of credit in a sudden emergency like an unexpected car or appliance repair. But it might be wise to evaluate current deductibles on home, car and health insurance to see if those amounts should be built into one’s emergency fund - many people keep deductibles fairly high to keep premiums low. Would you have cash on hand to cover deductibles if you had a sudden claim? If not, put that money in reserve."

Generally, you’ll get to your goal faster if you can cut your overall living expenses. For some, that means selling your home and moving to a smaller one or to an area with lower living costs and taxes. You can also sell or donate property you don’t need and use those proceeds to extinguish debt or add to savings or investments."

Es hilft, Ihre Käufe in Kategorien zu unterteilen, zum Beispiel: Wohnen, Verkehr, Kleidung, Unterhaltung, Nahrungsmittel, Gänge in Restaurants usw. Diese Übung kann Ihnen die Augen öffnen. Sie könnten erkennen, dass Sie bei 'schnellen Gängen' zum Gemüsehändler jeden Monat beinahe soviel ausgeben wie zum Beispiel für Ihren wöchentlichen Haupteinkaufsgang. Vielleicht erkennen Sie dabei auch, dass Sie zu viel Zeit in Cafés verbringen oder keinen Pfennig für schlechtere Zeiten gespart haben.
